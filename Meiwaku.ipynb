She suffers from Brutal Honesty and sometimes being Innocently Insensitive, and like many people with the syndrome, she has one thing she is strongly interested in - in her case, her studying.

And even then, she still acts much more sensible than the other victims: She decides to take a break from Yamada in order to not hurt him, and she stays away from the school because she is less affected by the power when she is far away.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Heterosexual Life-Partners',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": She becomes this with Itou as time goes on, usually hanging out with her when Yamada isn't available, and even confiding her crush on Yamada to her very early in the series.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Hey, You!',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": When she first got to know Yamada, she didn't call him by him name. When she grows closer to him and starts liking him during the next few chapters, she starts using his name much more.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Hidden Heart of Gold',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": Her cold personality at the start of the series is due to the fact that she doesn't want to get close to anyone, because every time she thought she had made friends throughout her life, they just ended up bullying her. Note that when she gets friends and realizes that there are, in fact, good people out there, she starts being much friendlier towards strangers.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'High-School Sweethearts',\n",

       "  {'trope_type': 'Hint Dropping',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": Although she's usually either a straight-shooter or completely quiet about her feelings, she does do some old-fashioned hint dropping in chapter 65 when she tries to follow Yamada around to meet the seventh witch. Even when she makes him promise that he'll be her first kiss once again, he still doesn't get that this may mean she likes him.\"},\n",

       "   'trope_description': \": She can always recognize the real Yamada when he has swapped bodies with another person, even though she didn't know about the swapping. Even masters of acting, like  Arisugawa, cannot fool her. Perhaps she just knows him that well.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Hypocrite',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": She has made it clear to Yamada that she always wants him to speak his mind and be open about things that are bothering him. Problem is, she doesn't have the best track record in that area herself. She completely bottled up her frustration about  Yamada spending too much time at the student council and her rivalry with Odagiri until a witch power made her spill it, and she doesn't reveal the fact that she would eventually have to leave Suzaku and forget everything about him.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Hypocrite Has a Point',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": She has a tendency to gently criticize Yamada for not sharing his worries and other bad feelings with her, even though she is generally worse than he is when it comes to bottling up her feelings. Despite that, her point is very much valid - in a relationship, you shouldn't go and hide everything from each other.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Hypocritical Humor',\n",
       "   'trope_description': ': She has more than once (albeit not angrily) called Yamada out for liking girls with big breasts, funnily unaware that she has one of the biggest pairs in the series herself, and how that may be one of the reasons he is so attracted to her.'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Idiot Ball',\n",
       "   'trope_description': ': She has written a diary about Yamada to help herself remember him if her memories of him are wiped again. Instead of doing the smart thing and placing it in her bag where she would easily find it, she does the stupid (albeit sentimental) thing and hides it among her valuables at home.  It takes Yamada more effort than should be necessary to convince her (after her memory is wiped) that she has it.'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': \"I'm Crying, but I Don't Know Why\",\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": She mentions, after forgetting Yamada, that she regularly starts breaking into tears for no apparent reason which is, of course, due to her Wistful Amnesia, but she doesn't know that.\"},\n",

       "   'trope_description': \": Even if she's a bit cold and aloof at the start (for understandable reasons), Shiraishi seems completely uncapable of being actually mean.

       "   'trope_description': \": Her intelligence is a downplayed example. There's no doubt that she is smart as she has shown to be observant and good at piecing clues together, but it depends on the situation how good she is - at times, some of the other characters, even Yamada, seem to be just as good or even better, even though Shiraishi's supposed to be the smartest of them all.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Innocently Insensitive',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": There is almost never any Subtext in what she says, so a few of the things she says without meaning to be hurtful can seem hurtful if you think there is subtext. There's also the fact that since she's a Shameless Fanservice Girl, she doesn't always understand that Yamada has more modesty and may not be entirely comfortable about her looking down his pants/taking them off while she's in his body.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Insufferable Genius',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": She was a minor case of this in the first chapter - she wasn't in-your-face about it, but it was obvious that she considered herself more intelligent than Yamada. In the second chapter, she also gets him a 99 in his make-up exam to show off without helping him perfectly.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Intelligence = Isolation',\n",

       "  {'trope_type': 'Jade-Colored Glasses',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": At the start, she was something of a cynic who had not too much faith left in other people - which is also why she wasn't quite as nice back then as she would later become. Fortunately, her spirit was lifted very quickly.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Jerk with a Heart of Gold',\n",
       "   'trope_description': ': At the start, she liked to hide her good heart behind an aloof facade. She would also regularly be a bit rude and comically honest. With time, she develops into a through-and-through Nice Girl.'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Kindhearted Cat Lover',\n",
       "   'trope_description': ': While it\\'s known from the start that she\\'s kind-hearted and has a cat, the \"cat lover\" aspect is emphasized when it\\'s revealed that her cat is actually a former stray cat that she decided to take in.'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Laugh of Love',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": She doesn't giggle very often, but when she does, it's always around Yamada. The only time she's shown breaking out into actual laughter is also around Yamada, when she laughs at his fear that he did some terrible things during the forgotten time of his first year to reassure him that he would never hurt anyone on purpose.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Lethal Chef',\n",
       "   'trope_description': ': A downplayed (for a shonen comic) example. She makes yakisoba for herself and Yamada that looks like two plates of burned sticks drowning in soy sauce. She thinks they taste just fine while Yamada is barely able to stomach them.'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Letting Her Hair Down',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": She wore her hair in pigtails and only started to let it down when she met Yamada, implying that he was the first one she met that she could relax around, and that she made her have other interests than just studying. She'll still revert to the pigtails once in while when she's in a particularly studious mood.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Light Feminine and Dark Feminine',\n",
       "   'trope_description': ': Of Yamada\\x92s two most serious suitors, she\\x92s the light feminine to Odagiri\\x92s dark feminine. She\\x92s gentle, sweet and wholesomely beautiful, while Odagiri is more hysterical, has a better grab on feminine wiles and is sexy more than she\\x92s outright beautiful.'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Literal-Minded',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": Not unheard of, given her often overly logical train of thought. For example when Yamada tells her that he wants her - as his girlfriend - to always be by his side, and she confusedly tells him how that's not possible since they live in different houses, sometimes take different classes etc.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Lonely Rich Kid',\n",
       "   'trope_description': ': Probably, since it certainly looks like she has a wealthy family, going by the size of their house. In the vein of the trope, her parents have never really been there for her, and she is definitely lonely and friendless at the start.'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Loners Are Freaks',\n",
       "   'trope_description': ': Yamada finds out why she has a Friendless Background when he notices other girls tended to bully her, and her parents were often not home. This resulted in her deliberately trying to distance herself from others.'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Loner-Turned-Friend',\n",
       "   'trope_description': ': She was a loner without too much trust in other people at the start, but when she realized Yamada only meant good, she quickly came to appreciate their friendship.'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Love Confession',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": She gives her first real, spontaneous one to Yamada in chapter 235 (before that, she had just been responding to Yamada's love confessions) when he goes out of his way to make sure she can focus on her own studies instead of his (yes, when it's Shiraishi we're talking about, that really is a grand romantic gesture).\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Love Confessor',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": As soon as during the summer camp, she confessed to Itou that she had fallen for Yamada, though it's not revealed that she did it until much later.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Loved I Not Honor More',\n",
       "   'trope_description': ': She knows Yamada has a specialness about him, and that his ability and quirks are needed to help deal with the school witches. Even after she and he start dating, she  gives him full permission to continue on with his job of helping the witches.'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Love Epiphany',\n",

       "  {'trope_type': 'Memory Gambit',\n",
       "   'trope_description': ': When she leaves Suzaku, and everyone forgets her as her term as the \"original witch\" ends, she sacrifices her own memories so that Yamada can still remember her as to make sure he\\'ll find her again and they can be together again.'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Minor Living Alone',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": Most of the time. Her parents officially live in the same house as her, but it's very rare for them to be at home, and they are certainly not caring parents. As such Shiraishi generally cares for herself, whether it's cooking, doing laundry or other things.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Mistaken for Badass',\n",

       "  {'trope_type': 'Misunderstood Loner with a Heart of Gold',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": Well, she's of course never believed to be evil, but both the readers and Yamada initially get the impression from her aloofness and solitaryness that she's snooty and indifferent to others' feelings, which is something that couldn't be further from the truth.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Morality Pet',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": To Yamada in the early chapters - he probably would have stayed a bored delinquent instead of the hero we know if it wasn't for her.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Mysterious Past',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": Her past and her parents are purposefully kept hidden until the very end of the series. Yamada notes earlier on than he doesn't know her as well as he should because she never talks about herself.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Mysterious Waif',\n",
       "   'trope_description': ': For most of the series, she has a Mysterious Past, and we never really know what she thinks, and what force actually brought her and Yamada together.'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Nerds Love Tough Schoolwork',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": She is constantly studying and actually likes taking all sorts of tests and exams (she would rather take Yamada's make-up exam for him than write the club report).\"},\n",

       "   'trope_description': ': Good luck making her show other states of mind than calmness and rationality. Or actually, if you do, beware.'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Never Be Hurt Again',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": The reason for her stoic and stand-offish demeanor at the start of the series is that every time she would try to make friends before high school, they ended up bullying her, so after that she didn't want to make friends with anyone again. (Well, until she grew close to Yamada)\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Nice Girl',\n",

       "  {'trope_type': 'Nice to the Waiter',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": She has never judged Yamada or treated him differently because of his bad reputation - she rarely brings it up, and when she does, it's usually out of sympathy. Even in the first chapter, when she is a bit cold and rude towards him, it\\x92s clearly because he acts like a bumbling idiot to her \\x96 not because she held anything against him before.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'No-Sell',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": As a witch, she is immune to other witch powers except for the seventh witch's powers. When she stops becoming a witch, she can be put under most witch powers, but she is still immune to the charm power, since her real love for Yamada is much stronger than the fake love the charm power induces.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'No Sympathy for Grudgeholders',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": Downplayed. She can understand that Yamada would hold a grudge towards Ushio for seemingly betraying him, but she doesn't give a damn about the fact that he feels entitled to not help Odagiri just because Ushio asks him to, and becomes pretty angry with him.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Not So Above It All',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": In her own subtle way, she can be just as silly as her friends - especially with her tendency to be The Comically Serious and her random bouts of cluelessness. Despite being logical-minded, she has a superstitious streak: She buys a love charm at a shrine, hoping it will work, and she mentions off-handedly that she doesn't wear red or white underwear at tests because blank paper is white and correction marks are red.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Not So Stoic',\n",
       "   'trope_description': ': While very calm, she is definitely not as unemotional as her facade would have you believe - it can be particularly when she becomes angry at Yamada in the first chapter or during the few scenes in which she cries.'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Oblivious to Love',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": She was just as unaware of Yamada's feelings for her as the opposite until he actually admits it to her. Also, when they do become a couple, she tends to act more like a platonic friend than a girlfriend because she, in her own words, doesn't know what a girlfriend should do.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'One True Love',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": To Yamada. They truly love each other and have never loved anyone else, fate has them meet again and again despite any memory-wipes (though actually, it's the wish Shiraishi made when she became the original witch that has them meet again as long as she goes to Suzaku), and they go from High-School Sweethearts to Happily Married with kids at the end.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Only Sane Woman',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": Sometimes, but not as often as you'd expect from a stoic, logical person. Usually, it's actually Yamada being the sane man instead.\"},\n",

       "  {'trope_type': 'Paralyzing Fear of Sexuality',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": A slightly more justified case than Yamada since she, as the girl, expects him to make the first move, but she's very awkward about sex when the chance actually arrives. Instead of opening her mouth or coming with more obvious hints, she just nervously waits for Yamada to do something, and nothing happens because Yamada himself is even more nervous.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Parental Neglect',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": Her parents are constantly working and are almost never at home (not even at New Year's Eve), so Shiraishi is always completely alone at home which she does not like to be. Her flashback shows that they don't really care about her as a person - they only care about her studies - and they just provide her with material necessities instead of giving her affection.\"},\n",

       "   'trope_description': ': Zigzagged. She is gentle-natured, polite, extremely loyal and nurturing to her man and at times a bit submissive like a lady should be according to old-fashioned beliefs. On the other hand, she has some less \"proper\" traits such as a knack for Brutal Honesty and next-to-none modesty around her body (to the point of being a Shameless Fanservice Girl).'},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Puppy-Dog Eyes',\n",
       "   'trope_description': \": Often, but it's usually not on purpose. One time when it's clearly on purpose is in chapter 175 when she asks Yamada to kiss her immediately if she loses her memory of him again.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'Purely Aesthetic Glasses',\n",

       "   'trope_description': \": She was temporarily written out of the story two times: When she was affected by Ichijo's witch power, as she stopped going to school in order to not hurt Yamada. When it's revealed she's moved overseas without saying goodbye to anyone, and thanks to Takuma, all students at Suzaku High but Yamada forget her.\"},\n",
       "  {'trope_type': 'The Quiet One',\n",
       "   'trope_description': ': Not overly so, but she generally only speaks when she feels she has something practical and meaningful to add to the conversation. After she started dating Yamada, she seems to have gotten over it, as she regularly wants to chitchat with him.'},\n",

       "   'trope_description': \": In a somewhat unconventional and subtle way, but she clearly tries to show that she is ready and willing to do the deed when she stays the night with Yamada, by inviting him to see her in the shower, and after the shower making it clear that she is Going Commando. Of course, Yamada doesn't get it at all (until next day at school).\"},\n",

       "   'trope_description': \": A temporary version. When she leaves Suzaku High at the middle of her third year, everybody (including those who would usually be immune to memory wipes) loses their memories of her. Unlike regular memory wipes where the forgotten people are still physically present at the school and as such can prove that they exist, Shiraishi leaves the school and country, and as such she effectively doesn't exist to anybody who ever knew her. The exception is Yamada because Shiraishi offered up her own memories to let him remember her. When they reunite at the graduation, Yamada manages to return everybody's memories.\"},\n",

Near the end, Asuka suddenly swaps bodies with her without her consent and has her confined in a house full of strangers - she is scared because she doesn't know if she'll get her body back, while the regret that she didn't believe Yamada when he told the truth also pains her.
